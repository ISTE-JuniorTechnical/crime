//Ernest and Cecil reach the location mentioned in the card. They analyze the
//surroundings. Serene atmosphere. The neighborhood seems to be deserted.
//They continue their path forward. They notice a person at a distance staring
//at them. Ernest walks in and tries the handle of the door. To their surprise the
//door was unlocked. Ernest smirks at Cecil. Withoutfurther delay, Ernest
//enters the house. Cecil follows him. But as he enters, he starts to hear the
//screaming voices again in his head.
//‘’JAKE...MAX....HARRY...STEVE...JACKSON…’’ Cecil loses his control. Suddenly
//a guy attempts to stab Cecil in the back. Ernest tries to stop him. The guy
//pushes him away and raises the knife to stab Cecil. Quick act to mention,
//Cecil turns and slaps the guy hard in the face. Cecil could no longer handle
//the voices and screams. By this time Earnest defeats the attacker and renders
//him unconscious using chloroform. Ernest approaches Cecil.

//After 1.5 Hrs.

//The attacker gains consciousness.
